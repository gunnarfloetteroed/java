/**
 * The SimulationEmulator has the purpose to create events for an agent's plan.
 * While the standard network simulation in MATSim performs a detailed
 * queue-based simulation with interacting agents the idea is here to create
 * events as quickly as possible, potentially loosing some of the dynamics.
 * However, this is meant to be a fast approximation of the actual network
 * simulation in MATSim.
