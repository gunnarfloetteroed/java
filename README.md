The repository contains the following programs:
* **bioroute** for sampling paths on a network
* **cadyts** for conditioning a transport simulator on traffic counts
* **opdyts** for approximately solving simulation-based transportation optimization problems

In addition, **utilities** is used by all of the above.

## BIOROUTE

BIOROUTE samples paths from a network according to arbitrary (not necessarily link-additive) path weights. It can be used as a pre-processor of BIOGEME for the estimation of route choice models, but it can also be used standalone for any other application that requires to sample paths.

## Cadyts

Cadyts estimates disaggregate demand models of dynamic traffic assignment simulators from traffic counts and vehicle re-identification data.

Cadyts has in the past been used to calibrate the following traffic simulators:
* MATSim (Multi-Agent Transport Simulation Toolkit); integration code can be found at https://github.com/matsim-org/matsim/tree/master/contribs/cadytsIntegration
* SUMO (Simulation of Urban Mobility)
* DRACULA (Dynamic Route Assignment Combining User Learning and Microsimulation)

## Opdyts

Opdyts approximately solves general simulation-based optimization problems subject to transport simulation constraints.
